       "'MemGPT abstracts away the complexity of managing the context window size with the external memory using a \"Virtual Context\", technique that is inspired by the way traditional operating systems use hierarchical memory systems to make it seem like they have vast memory resources by moving data between fast and slow memory. MemGPT allows LLMs to perform tasks that require long-term memory, such as document analysis and multi-session chat, by providing them with memory management functions and control flow mechanisms. MemGPT is an innovative method that expands the horizons and applications of LLMs. MemGPT, a product of OpenAI, is a cutting-edge language model that stands out for its memory management capabilities. It operates within a memory hierarchy, managing both working context and external context, and uses a function calling paradigm to interact with its environment. MemGPT is a language model system designed to address the limitations of fixed-length context windows in language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. It achieves this by introducing a novel architecture and principles that enable it to manage and utilize a virtually unlimited context. Here\\'s an overview of MemGPT\\'s technical architecture and ... MemGPT: Towards LLMs as Operating Systems. Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI, but are constrained by limited context windows, hindering their utility in tasks like extended conversations and document analysis. To enable using context beyond limited context windows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing ...'"
